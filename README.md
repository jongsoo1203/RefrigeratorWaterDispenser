## Overview

This project aims to automate the process of using a refrigerator water dispenser, saving you time and effort. By integrating an Arduino with the refrigerator, we've transformed a mundane task into a seamless experience. 

## Features

### 1. Remote Control Convenience

Our system reads signals from a remote controller, a simple numeric keypad. Each number corresponds to a specific water bottle, determining the precise amount of water to dispense.

### 2. Intelligent Display

The 1602 display provides real-time information on the dispensed water, ensuring clarity and convenience. The display shows the selected bottle size and dispensed ounces.

### 3. Motion-Activated Display

Worried about having the display on all the time? Fear not! We've integrated a motion sensor connected to an NPN transistor. The display activates only when someone approaches for water, enhancing energy efficiency.

### 4. Custom Filling Feature

Hosting guests or following a recipe that demands an exact amount of water? Input the desired ounces, and watch as the dispenser accurately delivers the specified amount â€“ a handy extra feature for any occasion.

## Technical Details

To ensure precision, we calculated the dispenser's flow rate and programmed the Arduino to adjust the dispensing time accordingly.

Make your mornings smoother, and add a touch of tech to your kitchen with the Smart Refrigerator Water Dispenser!
